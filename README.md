# Calculator

This is a calculator that was coded using HTML, CSS, and JS.

3/7/2022: Today I worked on the HTML and JS for my calculator. This included determining how to link clicking the buttons with changing the values displayed on screen. 

3/8/2022 and 3/9/2022: During these days, I worked on fleshing out the calculator and all of its intended functions. I also began work on the CSS for the calculator.
